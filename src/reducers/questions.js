/** 
 * A Reducer describes how an application's state changes. 
 * Youâ€™ll often see the Object Spread Operator (...) used inside of a reducer 
 * because a reducer must return a new object instead of mutating the old state. 
 * If you need a refresher on the spread operator, check out this ES6 lesson.
