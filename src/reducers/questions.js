 * TODO: Data integrity within reducers can be further preserved with the use of ImmutableJS.
 * 
 * A library such as ImmutableJS is used to:
 * 
 * preserve data type integrity (which is useful given Javascript's dynamic nature,
 * increase the speed of applications tremendously with certain data types (up to 30% - 40% from personal testing. You can run your own tests with JSPerf)
