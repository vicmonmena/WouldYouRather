## Coding Stage
Step 1 - Design the shape of the state and create reducers.

Step 2 - Create a Redux store. Connect logger middleware (optional) and Redux Thunk middleware (alternatively, you can use Redux Saga, etc.).

Step 3 - For each view that needs access to the store, create the component and connect it to the store.

Step 4 - For the component you created in the last step, create actions and action creators. Check that everything works correctly.

Step 5 - Repeat Step 3 & Step 4 for each component that needs access to the store.

Step 6 - Create presentational components and confirm that everything works correctly.

Step 7 - Add React Router.

Step 8 - Add finishing touches and make sure the project meets the rubric.
